                    Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your

                      other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                      and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                      ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25

                                Me and the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the

                                the building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona

                              <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can
                                join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is
                                very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My
                                wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!</p>

                              <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play
                                schedule and filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG

                              <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of
                                undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art
                                deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that
                                the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New
                                York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in
                                Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was
                                $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>Sanctions are political and economic decisions that are part of diplomatic
                          efforts by countries, multilateral or regional organizations against states or
                          organizations
                          either to protect national security interests, or to protect international law, and defend
                          against threats to international peace and security</li>
                        <li>These decisions principally include the temporary imposition on a target of economic,
                          trade, diplomatic, cultural or other restrictions (sanctions measures) that are lifted
                          when
                          the motivating security concerns no longer apply, or when no new threats have arisen.
