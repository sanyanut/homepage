(BINARY STUDIO WINTER ACADEMY 2021 ❄️)

  This website created especially for Donald Trump. Basically this is just a résumé. 😆
  
  It consists of a number of major blocks: **Experience**, **Personal life**, **Media Career**.

  Also website has secondary blocks: Languages, Skills, Character, Likes (with some SANCTIONS lul), Dislikes, Wants, Education and some MEMES! 🤩


  To create it, I used the stylesheet from https://volodymyrkushnir.com/ as a foundation and [Résumé Wiki](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9#content) framework.
  There is neither additional **JS** code nor additional **CSS** outside. Only framework with the exception of some style rules inside html       document.
  Badum-tssss 🥁🙀
